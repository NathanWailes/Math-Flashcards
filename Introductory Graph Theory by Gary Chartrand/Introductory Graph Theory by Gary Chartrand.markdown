##Chapter 1 - Mathematical Models

###1.1 Nonmathematical Models

Main Ideas
What is a model?||This is the term used to refer to something which represents something else.||double-sided
What are some examples of everyday (that is, nonmathematical) models?||What these things have in common: A map<rb>a miniature 3D version of an apartment complex<rb>a furnished apartment that no one lives in, used by a real-estate salesman to give people an idea of what a similar apartment would look like once moved into<rb> a swimsuit model<rb>a miniature airplane/car.||double-sided

What determines whether a model is accurate or not?||Whether the model gives an accurate-enough picture of the real thing depends on which features of the real thing are important to you.||

Problem Set
1. Give three examples of models you have encountered. Indicate some pertinent features of each model and describe a feature each model lacks which would be useful for it to possess.||1) Boardgames like Risk and Diplomacy are models for international war. They both feature representations of the countries in the world, as well as the need to cooperate with other powers to avoid being conquered. However, neither game features a representation of politics WITHIN a nation (eg the need for a leader to gain support within his own country).2) 
2. Give an example of a model which is (a) larger than, (b) approximately the same size as the thing it represents.||(a) Those 3D/2D models you see in science classes of really small things, like atoms and bugs and neurons.
(b)A fake skeleton, fake brain.||

3. Explain the relationship that radio, television, motion pictures, and the theater have with models. What are some of the pertinent differences in how these media model?||Hmm...well, those media USE models when creating their media: weathermen on the radio or TV use mathematical models to predict the weather, and then they use 2D geographical models (maps) to show people what the weather will look like.<rb>Actually, you could say that radio / TV shows, movies, and plays/musicals are usually models of real-world events.<rb><rb>As for differences:<rb>Radio models what you would HEAR, but not what you would SEE in a real-world experience, while TV/movies/plays all model what you would see. Theater has life-sized models of the people you would see in the real-world, while TV is usually shrunk down, and movies are often blown up to larger-than-life size. Theater often models the surrounding environment using backdrop-paintings, while TV / movies usually film on-location or in a similar-looking location (eg filming a movie about Iraq in Jordan).||

4. List some occupations which deal directly with nonmathematical models.||Fashion (actual people-models), teachers (3D plastic models of various phenomena), hobbyists (making model airplanes, model cars), policemen (if they have a map on their wall to show the location of crimes).||

###1.2 Mathematical Models
What is a mathematical model?||___ is when you represent or identify a real-life situation or problem with a mathematical system.||double-sided
What are some examples of mathematical models?|| ||

Main Ideas
Blah blah blah.
Problem Set
5. Why is the mathematical model described in Example 1.1 likely to be unsatisfactory?
6. What question would you like the mathematical model of Example 1.2 to answer?

7. You take a quart of milk whose temperature is 40° and you place it on the kitchen counter. The temperature in the kitchen is 75°. After 1 hour, the temperature of the milk has risen to 45°. What mathematical model would represent this situation?

8. In your opinion, what would be a better mathematical model than the given model for the situation described in Example 1.3? Why is yours preferable?

9. Imagine yourself in the position of the college senior of Example 1.4. List the alternatives you would choose and the factors that are important to you in making a decision. What do you think of this method of making decisions?

10. Give an example of a decision you are likely to make in the near future. Proceed as in Example 1.4 by listing alternatives, indicating important criteria, and assigning points.

11. What is the most important question a mathematical model for Example 1.5 should answer?

12. The following problem is rather common in a beginning calculus course. A square piece of cardboard, 12 centimeters on a side, is to have squares (all of the same size) cut out of its corners. Then its sides will be folded upward to produce a box with no top. What kind of mathematical model would represent this situation? What question would you like the mathematical model to answer?

13. Suppose you have a fair coin; that is, it is equally likely for heads or tails to appear if the coin is flipped. You are approached by a compulsive gambler who states that if you flip this coin four times and heads and tails appear twice each, then he will pay you $11. On the other hand, if you fail, you will pay him only $10. What kind of mathematical model would you identify with this situation? What question would you like the mathematical model to answer?

14. You must pay $10 to play the following game at a carnival. You flip a fair coin three times. When heads comes up the first time, you receive $5. If heads comes up a second time, you receive an additional $7. If heads occurs a third time, you receive yet another $9. Hence, it is possible to receive as much as $5 + $7 + $9 = $21 (for a net profit of $11) or as little as nothing (for a net loss of $10). What kind of mathematical model would you identify with this situation? What question should your model answer for you?

###1.3 Graphs

Main Ideas

###1.4 Graphs as Mathematical Models

Main Ideas
Blah blah blah.
Problem Set
25. In the graph of Example 1.6, what observation could you expect to make concerning the vertex associated with the "most popular child" in the class? What would you expect to find concerning a vertex associated with a new child in the class? Is it possible that a graph constructed at the beginning of the school year might be different from one constructed at the end of the school year? How could this happen?
26.* Suppose we associate a graph G with a college class in the following manner. The vertices of G correspond to the students in the class, while two vertices of G are adjacent if and only if they correspond to two students having the same major. Can you describe the appearance of G?

27. In Example 1.7, it might be important for two platoons to communicate (indirectly, if not directly). How is it possible to determine by looking at the graph of Example 1.7 whether every two platoons can communicate with each other?

28. What would be an important question to ask concerning the situation described in Example 1.8? Could this question be answered with the aid of the corresponding graph?

29. The Student Council in a certain high school consists of 15 members. Ten different committees in school are made up of Student Council members. Some committees may have only a few members, while others may have many. Some Student Council members may below to no committees, and other members may below to several. Give examples of two graphs which describe this situation. Can you think of conditions which may make one graph more useful than the other?

30.* We can generalize Exercise 29 in the following way. Let U be a finite nonempty set, and let S1, S2, ..., Sn be a collection of nonempty subsets of U. Find two examples of graphs which describe this situation.

37. Give an example (of a type different from Example 1.11) in which a signed graph is an appropriate mathematical model.
38. Why is the situation described in Example 1.13 more conducive to representation by a multigraph than is the situation described in Example 1.12?

39. In Example 1.10 we indicated how a digraph can help describe the traffic pattern of a city having one-way and two-way streets. Explain how a directed network may be more useful than a digraph in describing this situation for a letter carrier.

40. A businessman is driving from Michigan City, Indiana, to O'Hare Airport in Chicago. He reaches an intersection where he has the option of continuing along the main highway, where the traffic increases significantly, or taking a different route which is faster but requires paying a toll of $1.40. Give two possible networks representing the situation, and explain the usefulness of one network over the other.

41. Describe a situation in which the most appropriate mathematical model would have loops.

42. State a definition of "loop-digraph". Considering the type of relation associated with a loop-digraph, what other term might be more appropriate than "loop-digraph".
